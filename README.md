# Gallegos-5 (G5) Reform Portfolio

A suite of open, next-generation legislative proposals to modernize U.S. public sector governance for the AI era.

---

## Overview

**Gallegos-5 (G5)** is a portfolio of “process-first” federal reform acts, designed to rebuild U.S. governance around transparency, participation, auditability, and rapid iteration. The G5’s mission: to unlock innovation and accountability in an era shaped by artificial intelligence, public skepticism, and complex national challenges.

Each Act in the G5 can stand alone, but together, they form a pipeline for safe, transparent, and citizen-powered policy.

## Vision

> **G5 is built on four principles:**  
> **Transparency** over secrecy.  
> **Process over ideology.**  
> **Accountability** at every step.  
> **Safe-to-fail experimentation** with sunset and review.

The G5 is proof that “anyone can innovate”—demonstrating that bold, high-standards reform is possible even from outside traditional policy circles.
